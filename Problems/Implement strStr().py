Implement strStr()
https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/203/introduction-to-string/1161/
#Easy #Array

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Constraints:
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
