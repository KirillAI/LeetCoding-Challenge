Symmetric Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

#         self.left = left

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def bst(left, right):
            if not left and not right:
                return True
            if not left or not right:
                return False
            return left.val == right.val and bst(left.left, right.right) and bst(left.right, right.left)
        return bst(root, root)
